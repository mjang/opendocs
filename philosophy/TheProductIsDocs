Writers and Developers

An idea persists that technical writers and developers are cut from different cloth. It suggests that the former would never understand the product but is good with language, and the latter is terrible at communicating but competent with code.

Each stereotype rolls their eyes at the other, certain they cannot possibly understand.

Thus, one must hire a tech writer who understands and can work with uncommunicative, deeply introverted engineers.

That is irksome.

At the first hint of this prejudice from a tech writing candidate, I am discouraged.

Plenty of writers have a deep understanding of the product about which they write. Indeed, they are often the first end user.

And developers can be excellent communicators, progressively disclosing complex information naturally...

In today's documentation world, writers and developers use the same tools and the same project-management methods.

Let's move beyond the stereotypes and recognize that the boundary between writers and developers is thin and permeable.
