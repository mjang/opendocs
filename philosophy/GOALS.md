From the Write the Docs Slack, h/t Monique Semp

Learn the project so well that:

- When an engineer/marketing person/sales person asks a question (assuming that there’s a public channel for such things, such internal Slack), you can answer it.
- Make your docs serve as the source of truth when discrepancies are found in internal docs, or one engineer says one thing, but the other engineer says another thing.

Empathize with the user:

- Really use the product hard, and when you inevitably find things that are really difficult for the user to do (even though the “issues” are not bugs), file usability or style & polish issues in whatever issues tracking system is being used.

Cultivate a climate of trust is basically being a good and useful team-mate:

- Be judicious in honestly evaluating the relative importance of docs. (I recently sighed, publicly, “if only you [engineers] wouldn’t keep putting out patch releases that take up my time, I’d have time to write a bunch of new content. But… then the docs would be moot because the product wouldn’t work right!”
- Meet people where they are: do not demand that they provide answers to your questions in a specific way/manner. Let everyone work with you as they want. Some people like Slack-chat. Some like voice-meetings. Some like video-meetings. Some like email. Some like to put everything into a little Google doc. Whatever. Accept info however it is provided.
