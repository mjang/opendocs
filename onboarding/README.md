# [Writing onboarding toolkit](https://github.com/google/opendocs/blob/main/onboarding/README.md)

A resource to help you develop or improve writer onboarding information in your organization. This toolkit is a companion to the talk "Level up - Onboarding that enables writers to thrive" for [Write the Docs Portland 2021](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2021/).

The [toolkit](onboarding-toolkit.md) provides a checklist of content to consider for your onboarding, as well as resources to support you.

What you include in your onboarding, and how you present that information will depend on role of the writer in your organization and the maturity of your doc practices.

- If doc practices are new in your organization, work together with your writer to define their role and determine how to incorporate the doc lifecycle into your project lifecycle.
- If doc practices are more established, use the checklist to identify gaps or opportunities to make your onboarding information more cohesive.

Instead of trying to cover everything, the goal of onboarding is to provide a map to help your writer navigate your organization and its practices. It should provide enough information to help a writer feel welcome, gain confidence, and feel supported as they grow with you.
