# Writer onboarding toolkit

## Overview

This toolkit helps you to prepare a new writer who is joining your team. It
includes a checklist that helps you to:

-  Identify and prioritize information your writer needs
-  Support continued learning after initial onboarding
-  Provide pathways for long-term growth
-  Find resources and examples to use for your writer onboarding

### Using the toolkit

Writer onboarding is like a map. It highlights key information and helps a
writer to navigate their new world. The important things to include in your
onboarding are going to depend on your specific context.

For example:

-  You're hiring a writer to support multiple teams or write content outside
   of product documentation, such as blog posts for community engagement or
   marketing white papers.
-  Your writer will use the same workflow and tools as software developers
   on your team, which means you can repurpose or reuse existing developer
   education.
-  You're hiring your first writer, so roles, tools, and processes are not
   established. You can focus more on describing existing tools and processes,
   and identify opportunities for writers to actively engage with the team
   throughout the lifecycle of your projects.
-  You're a pioneering first tech writer. You'll be observing existing
   practices and working with stakeholders to shape your role and processes.
-  You're an open source project and want to make it simpler for volunteers
   to join and contribute to your project documentation.

This toolkit lists types of information to consider for your writer onboarding.
Use them as building blocks to identify what information you have now, what gaps
you need to fill or discuss with your new writer, and where to focus your
initial onboarding efforts.

If you don't have established doc practices, that's ok. The focus will be on
learning together with your writer and partnering to define the writer role, doc
lifecycle, and a collaboration model that includes the writer throughout your
project lifecycle.

## Onboarding content

### What

Identify sources of information for creating the docs, and the content that your
writer will deliver.

#### Doc input

What information can your writer use to understand your projects and your
users?

-  Design docs
-  Test plans
-  Existing documentation, training, and support information
-  User and community engagement channels (forums, chat rooms)
-  Issues and pull requests

-  Consider setting up a doc focus group with developers, support
   - Set up feedback, help

#### Deliverables (Doc output)

What are your doc deliverables? Which ones does your writer own, and which ones
do they review?

-  Internal docs
-  External docs
-  Doc plans
-  Other communication
   -  Blogs
   -  Video
   -  Images

### Who

Describe users and your stakeholders for your docs.

#### Users

Provide background on who uses your product or service so that your writer can
align docs with what your users need.

-  Internal/External
-  Consumer, enterprise, small business
-  Domain (for example, technology, healthcare, education, finance,
   manufacturing)
-  Assumed knowledge and skills
-  Who are your stakeholders?
   -  PM, Support, Marketing, Training, Engineering
   -  External partners
   -  Other product teams
   -  (For open source) steering committee members or interest group leads

#### Stakeholders

Identify the key people who contribute to doc development.

-  Engineering
-  Test
-  Support
-  Training
-  Sales and marketing
-  Contacts for partner teams
-  Steering committee members or SIG (special interest group) members

Identify templates appropriate to each group.

Consider setting up onboarding options for others to contribute to docs.

#### Leadership and organizational structure

Describe where your writer is in the larger organization.

-  Team Lead and Manager
   -  Dedicated doc manager or manager with other expertise (e.g.
      Marketing, Support, Engineering).
      -  Writers who report to managers in other areas often need to
         partner with their manager to clearly identify doc and writer needs.

   -  If there's a writing team lead, what are their responsibilities?
   -  How much ownership does the writer have over prioritizing and
      scheduling work?

-  Mentor
   -  Inside the team for project work
   -  Outside the team for growth

-  Open Source
   -  Is there a requirement for documentation before a pull request is merged?
   -  Is there a documentation working group?
   -  Are documentation issues tagged with a â€˜docs' label?

### How

If you don't have established doc practices, it can be difficult to imagine what
a new writer might need - or even determine where to start. Use these resources
to help you:

-  Documentation practices
   -  [The Product is Docs](https://www.amazon.com/Product-Docs-technical-documentation-development/dp/1973589400)
      is a book about documentation practices in modern software development.
      It's written by the Splunk documentation team, but the guidance applies
      widely to software, and to some extent other technical domains.
-  Writer and contributor guide examples
      -  [GitLab tech writing team docs](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ux/technical-writing/)
      -  [Kubernetes doc contribution guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/)
-  Community
   -  [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/) is a community of people who
      care about documentation. There's a wealth of information about doc practices.

      technical roles to write more clearly.

#### Tools

Identify tools for the following tasks:

-  Authoring and publishing
-  Managing docs (wiki, source control, content management system)
-  Tracking doc work (Issue tracker, Kanban, spreadsheet)
-  Reviewing and approving docs
-  Templates, style guide, and other resources
   -  Style guides frequently used in software development

#### Doc lifecycle

Writers should be involved throughout the lifecycle of projects. If defining
these processes is new, you can work with your writer to identify how your tools
support these processes and if there are gaps.

Think about how you can incorporate the following processes in your current
project lifecycle.

-  Contributing to design (reviewing design docs, test plans, UI mockups)
-  Managing and prioritizing writer work requests
-  Doc planning and signoff
-  Doc reviews
   -  Tools and stakeholders
   -  Approval for publishing

-  Maintenance model
   -  Frequency of updates to docs
   -  Maintaining docs for multiple releases or product versions
   -  Continuous publishing

-  Managing Internal and external feedback (bugs, ratings)

-  Announcements. Find appropriate locations (internal and external)
   to announce doc updates / releases
   - May include standup teams, demos, etc.
   - Define how to sync doc changes to product releases

### Career

Often information about career expectations and career growth for writers is
unclear. Examples for setting goals or demonstrating impact tend to be focused
on roles with a larger number of team members, such as Engineering or Sales.

Clearly defining your writer's role, performance expectations, and
opportunities for growth helps your writer to prioritize and focus their work,
and continue to grow and contribute to your organization's success.

#### Current role

-  Ownership and leadership
-  Knowledge of the domain and your products/services
-  Impact on the product/service, team, users
Examples could include:
   -  Improved doc coverage
   -  Increased user engagement
   -  Improvements to user experience based on docs or feedback on product
      design
   -  Reduced support load on top issues
   -  Better integration experience across components
   -  Improved process resulting in increased team productivity
   -  Leading projects (planning, execution, successful delivery,
      addressing issues that arise)
   -  External contributions (blog, talks, teaching, open source)
   -  Peer, stakeholder, and user feedback

#### Growth

-  Opportunities and criteria for upward or lateral movement
-  Opportunities for learning (mentors, education, conferences)
