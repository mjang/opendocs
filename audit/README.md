# [Documentation maturity audit](https://github.com/google/opendocs/blob/main/audit/README.md)

A resource provided by your friends from Google Season of Docs, Google Open Source, and contributors.

The [documentation content maturity checklist](checklist.md) and [documentation inventory guide](inventory.md) help open source maintainers and contributors identify the documentation and docs process they already have and learn how to take it to the next level.

These materials are:

- A tool to help you understand what you’ve already achieved with your documentation and to celebrate your successes, no matter how early.
- A tool to help you contextualize your open source project’s documentation content and processes.
- A tool to help you create your own documentation roadmap.

These materials are not:

- A to-do list. Your project might not need everything here depending on the project’s overall level of maturity, software complexity, and the resources available to you and your collaborators.
- A standard against which to judge other projects or teams. Use these tools introspectively; from the outside, you may not be able to determine whether a project has satisfied a point on the checklist, even if it has.

## Get started

Before you begin, collect any resources related to learning about your project, such as links to:

- The project website
- Source code
- Issue trackers
- Discussion forums
- Mailing lists

Then follow these steps:

1. Create an inventory of your documentation content by following the [documentation inventory guide](inventory.md).
2. Compare your project to the [documentation content maturity checklist](checklist.md).

Although the [documentation inventory guide](inventory.md) and [documentation content maturity checklist](checklist.md) are complementary tools that work best together, each stands alone. If you have relatively little content to audit or you want to complete a limited, preliminary audit faster, then start with the [documentation content maturity checklist](checklist.md).
